# Kotlin Android Applications from the udacity course

This repository contains the Android applications that I made while going through the Udacity course on Android-development (beginner level)
It contains the following applications
 - **CourtCounter** : Demonstrates the use of push button and a bit of styling
 - **HappyBirthday** : A very basic application, loads an image that says HappyBirthday (Greeting application)
 - **HelloAndroid** : Most basic `hello world` application
 - **JustJava** : This application demonstrates how to accept user input and pass data to an email application (gmail)
 - **Nutrition Quiz** : This application demonstrates the usage of a list Adapter, checkbox, option buttons etc. The final application is an informative nutrition quiz.
